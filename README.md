Marshmallow Runtime Permission Feature Demo

Working with System Permissions (Android 6.0)

To protect the system's integrity and the user's privacy, Android runs each app in a limited access sandbox. If the app wants to use resources or information outside of its sandbox, the app has to explicitly request permission. Depending on the type of permission the app requests, the system may grant the permission automatically, or the system may ask the user to grant the permission.

This Demo shows you how to declare and request permissions for your app.
